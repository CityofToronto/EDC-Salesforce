    <subject>Happy Holidays from DMS (plus a present for your members)!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Just wanted to a take a quick second to wish you an extremely happy holiday! It has been a great year at Digital Main Street and we could not have done it without the help of the BIAs across the city – so THANK YOU!

As we get ready for 2018, we have a lot of exciting stuff coming down the pipeline and I will be sure to share it with you as it comes.

As an early present to your members – we have launched the next cohort of our Starter Company Plus program in conjunction with Camp Tech that will be taking place every Wednesday in February and March from 1-4pm. Any businesses that register before December 31st at 11pm can do so for 25% off  using the promo code “dmsholidays”.

All eligible participants can receive a grant of $2,500 towards a digital transformation plan. More details about the cohort can be found here: https://goo.gl/Jwa5Ge.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly – but other than that I look forward to working with all of you moving forward.

Happy Holidays!
