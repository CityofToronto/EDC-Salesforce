<p>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>Just wanted to a take a quick second to wish you an extremely happy holiday! It has been a great year at Digital Main Street and we could not have done it without the help of the BIAs across the city &ndash; so THANK YOU!</p>
<p>As we get ready for 2018, we have a lot of exciting stuff coming down the pipeline and I will be sure to share it with you as it comes.</p>
<p>As an early present to your members &ndash; we have launched the next cohort of our <strong>Starter Company Plus</strong> program in conjunction with Camp Tech that will be taking place every Wednesday in February and March from 1-4pm. Any businesses that register before December 31<sup>st</sup> at 11pm can do so for <strong>25% off </strong>&nbsp;using the promo code &ldquo;dmsholidays&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All eligible participants can receive a grant of $2,500 towards a digital transformation plan. More details about the cohort can be found here: <a href="https://goo.gl/Jwa5Ge">https://goo.gl/Jwa5Ge</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to me directly &ndash; but other than that I look forward to working with all of you moving forward.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
