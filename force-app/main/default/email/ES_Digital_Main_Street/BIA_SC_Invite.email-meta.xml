    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you’re well.

As I am sure you have seen, Digital Main Street is in the middle of our Starter Company Plus – Digital Main Street Program’s second cohort – with at least two more to go. We have seen great success so far with businesses from across the city and various BIAs participating in the training program.

I am reaching out to let you know – we want to offer you the opportunity to participate in the training program as a representative of your respective BIA at no cost. This will give you the opportunity to advance your own digital knowledge to help modernize the BIAs operations, while also arming you with the knowledge to answer any questions your members may have regarding embracing digital – all well still qualifying to receive a grant of $2,500 to use towards advancing the BIA’s digital agenda.

Here are links to the Starter Company Plus program remaining cohorts in September and October. If you would like to register for either cohort, please use the promotional code “dmsbia” to join at no cost.

If you have any questions about the program, or would like to talk with me about it further – please let me know.

Thanks!
