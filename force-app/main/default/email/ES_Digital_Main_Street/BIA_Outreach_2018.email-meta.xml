    <subject>Digital Main Street can help your BIA in 2018!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I want to thank you for your ongoing support of Digital Main Street. Together we are helping Toronto&#39;s main street businesses grow by providing them the tools and knowledge to undergo a digital transformation.

2017 was an exciting year for us as we continued to grow and work with more main street businesses throughout Toronto. In just over a year, the Digital Service Squad has worked directly with 14 BIAs and engaged over 2000 businesses through the DMS platform.
However, we know that businesses want more hands-on support and the Digital Service Squad can offer them that. DMS has proven to be very popular with BIA members as a hands on practical offering from the BIA. If your BIA is interested in working with the Digital Service Squad, please review the information link below and contact me directly to discuss. 2018 is coming fast!

What are other BIAs saying?
Please see the attached file for a series of testimonials from BIA staff that Digital Main Street have actively worked with. I can sit here all day and tell you about the great work we have done – but I want you to hear your colleague’s thoughts on Digital Main Street and the effect it can have on local businesses within your BIA.

I would love to come and meet with you and talk about how the Digital Service Squad and DMS can help your BIA!</textOnly>
