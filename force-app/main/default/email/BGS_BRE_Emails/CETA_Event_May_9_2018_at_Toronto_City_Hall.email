<p>Good Afternoon,

<p>With the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) now in force and on the occasion of Europe Day on May 9, 2018, the City of Toronto Economic Development and Culture Division in partnership with the World Trade Centre Toronto, is hosting a half-day program, "Uncovering the CETA Opportunity", at Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, Council Chambers, from 11:00 a.m. â€“ 12:30 p.m. with a Networking Luncheon to follow in the Member's Lounge.

<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to personally invite you to attend and to please extend the invitation to your business network that may benefit from such an event.  All guests can register online at <a href= "https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/uncovering-the-ceta-opportunity-europe-day-toronto-business-program-tickets-44240468432">EUROPEDAY2018TORONTO.EVENTBRITE.CA <a/> (please see attached flyer).
