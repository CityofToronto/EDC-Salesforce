Good morning {!Contact.FirstName} - I trust the weekend was good to you.

Our 2016 Small Business Forum is next week and I was hoping you could please help do one last push to your networks.  We've got 3,500 people registered, but we'd like to see that at 5,000 by week's end.

If you don't mind here's some Twitter and Facebook posts:
