Good afternon {!Contact.FirstName} - hope all is well.

I wanted to let you know that the City is co-hosting a networking event with Techstars tomorrow evening to welcome Paddy Cosgrave, the CEO of Web Summit, to Toronto.

If you're available to join us, feel free to drop by WeWork's 240 Richmond Street West location tomorrow (March 13th) between 6 pm. and 8 p.m.

Hope you can join us.
